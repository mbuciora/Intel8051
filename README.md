# Project Title
Design and implementation of the Intel 8051 processor

## Description
As part of a computer architecture class with a colleague, we decided to design and implement the Intel 8051 processor. <br />
We succeeded in completing the task successfully. 
We resigned from the full implementation of the processor to make <br />it a slightly truncated version that was supposed to work just like the MCS-51 family.
